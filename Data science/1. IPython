1) pip install ipython

2) pip install jupyterlab

3) type "jupyter notebook" on command line

4)  Every Python object contains the reference to a string, known as a docstring, which in most cases will contain a  summary of the object and how to use it. To access this information we can use ?
    eg, len?

5) We can also access source code by using ??
   
    eg, def square():
            pass
        square??

6) Tab completion of object contents
   
    eg, L.<TAB>           #pressing TAB key

7) Tab completion when importing

    eg, from itertools import co<TAB>

8) If youâ€™d like to match characters at the middle or end of the word use *  

    eg, *Warning?

9) suppose we are looking for a string method that contains the word find somewhere in its name. We can search for it this way:

    str.*find*?
