1) Falsy values are treated as if they are false. The table to the left shows a highScore variable with a series of values, all of which are falsy.

2) Falsy values can also be treated as the number 0 .
   
       Value                        Description
a) var highScore=false;           Boolean false

b) var highScore=0;               Number zero

c) var highScore='';              NaN

d) var highScore=10/'score';      Empty value

e) var highScore;                 A variable with no value assigned to it.


3) Truthy values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true. 

4) Truthy values can also be treated as the number 1.

      Value                        Description
a) var highScore=true;           Boolean true

b) var highScore=1;              Numbers other than zero

c) var highScore='carrot';       Strings with content

d) var highScore=10/5;           Number calculations

e) var highScore='true';         True written as a string

f) var highScore='0';            Zero written as a string

g) var highScore='false';        false written as a string

5) The presence of an object or an array or an element in HTML is usually considered truthy.

  eg, if (document.getElementById('header')) {
        
           // Found: do something
   
      } else {
        
           //Not fou nd: do somethi ng else
   
      }
           If the element is found, the result is truthy.

6) if(document.getElementById('header') ==true) Here document.getElementById ('header') would return an object which is a truthy value but it is not equal to a Boolean value of true.

7) If you use == the then false, 0, and ' ' (empty string) are equal. However, for === they are not equal.
           false == 0   truthy
           false === 0  falsy

8) Although null and undefined are both falsy, they are not equal to anything other than themselves.
          (undefined == null)     truthy
           (null == false)        falsy
        (undefined == false)      falsy
             (null == 0)          falsy
          (undefined == O)        falsy
         (undefined === null)     falsy

9) NaN is considered falsy, it is not equivalent to anything. Also NaN==NaN is falsy.
         (Nan == null)     falsy
	 (NaN == NaN)      falsy

10) var artist ='variable1' ;
    var artistA = (artist ||'Okay') ;
        Here artistA will get the value variable1

11) var artist='';
    var artistA= (artist ||'Okay'); 
	Here artistA will get the Okay.

12) You could even create an empty object if artist does not have a value:
    var artist= '';
    var artistA = (artist || {}) ;
