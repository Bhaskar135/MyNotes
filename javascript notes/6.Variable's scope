1) Local variable : When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function.
    
    *) Two different functions can use variables with the same name without any kind of naming conflict.

2) Global variable : If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.
  
    *) If you forget to declare a variable using the var keyword, the variable will work, but it will be treated as a global variable.
    *) Global variables use more memory.
    *) If an HTML page uses two JavaScript files, and both have a global variable with the same name, it can cause errors.
    
  eg, function getArea(width, height){
         var area = width * height;     // area local variable
         return area ;
      }
      var wallSize = getArea(3, 2);     // wallSize global variable
      document.write(wallSize);

3) A variable actually references a value that is stored in memory.

4) The same value in memory can be referenced by more than one variable:
