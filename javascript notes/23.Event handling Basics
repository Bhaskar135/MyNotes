1) When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling :
    a) Select the element node(s) you want the script to respond to.
    b) Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.
    c) State the code you want to run when the event occurs.

2) Three ways to bind an event to an element : Event handlers let you indicate which event you are waiting for on any particular element. There are three types of event handlers.

    a) HTML event handlers(bad practice)

    b) Traditional DOM event handlers : The main drawback is that you can only attach a single function to any event.
        eg, the submit event of a form cannot trigger one function that checks the contents of a form, and a second to submit the form data if it passes the checks.

    c) DOM level 2 event listener : These newer event listeners allow one event to trigger multiple functions.
