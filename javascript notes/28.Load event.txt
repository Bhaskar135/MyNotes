1) Here the eventListener is attached to the window object (not the document object)
 
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name">
        <script>
            function setup() {
                var textInput;
                textInput = document.getElementById('name');
                textInput.focus();
            }
            window.addEventListener('load' , setup , false);
        </script>

*) In this example, a function called setup() gives focus to the text input when the page has loaded.

*) The event is automatically raised by the window object when a page has finished loading the HTML and all of its resources: images, CSS, scripts (even third party content e.g, banner ads).
