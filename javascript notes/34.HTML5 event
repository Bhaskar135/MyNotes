1) DOMContentLoaded : 
     a) Event fires when the DOM tree is formed (images, CSS, and JavaScript might still be loading).
     b) Using this event scripts start to run earlier than using the load event which waits for other resources such as images and advertisements to load. This makes the page seem faster to load.
     c) It can be attached to the window or document objects.

2) hashchange :
     a) Event fires wh en the URL hash changes (without the entire window refreshing).
     b) The hashchange event handler works on the window object, and after firing, the event object will have oldURL and newURL properties that hold the url before and after the hashchange.

3) beforeunload : 
     a) Event fires on the window object before the page is unloaded.
     b) It can be helpful to let a user know that changes on a form they completed have not been saved.

     eg,    
        <form method="POST">
            <input type="text" id="message">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <script>
            function setup() {
                var textInput;
                textInput = document.getElementById('message');
                textInput.focus();
            }
            window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',setup,false);
            window.addEventListener('beforeUnload',function(event){
                return 'You have changes that have not been saved...' ;
            },false);
            
        </script>
