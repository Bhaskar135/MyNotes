1) There are two types of containers : 
    a) .container-fluid : It is a full-width box and will stretch the layout to fit the entire width of the browser window.There is some left and right padding added.
          <div class="container-fluid">
              ...
          </div>
 
    b) .container : It will have a fixed width based on the size of your device's viewport.
          <div class="container">
              ...
          </div>

2) There are five different sizes in Bootstrap, with the following width values:
        Extra small <576px
        Small ≥576px
        Medium ≥768px
        Large ≥992px
      Extra large ≥1200px

3) Creating a layout without a container : If you want a full width layout but you don't want the default left and right padding it can be achieve by just removing the <div> with the container class on it.
 
4) Multiple containers on a single page :
     <div class="container">
         ......
     </div>
     <div class="container">
         ......
     </div>

5) Bootstrap contains 12 columns.

6) Inserting rows into your layout :
    <div class="container">
	<div class="row">
	    <!-- insert column code here //-->
        </div>
        <div class="row">
	    <!-- insert column code here -->
        </div>
    </div>

7) Adding columns to your layout : In Bootstrap there were five different column class widths to choose from :
    
    a) extra small : The class is .col-# , where -# is equal to a number from 1 to 12. The extra smallcolumn class is for targeting mobile devices that have a max-width of 544 pixels.
    
    b) small : The class is .col-sm-# . It is targeted for devices with a resolution greater than 544 pixels but smaller than 720 pixels.

    c) medium : The class is .col-md-# . This column class is for devices greater than 720 pixels and smaller than 940 pixels.

    d) large : The class is .col-lg-# . This column class targets devices that are larger than 940 pixels but smaller than 1140 pixels.

    e) extra large : The class is .col-xl-# . This column class option is for all resolutions greater than or equal to 1140 pixels.

8) For building a responsive website use either the medium or large column classes.

9) Creating a two column layout :
   <div class="container-fluid">
       <div class="row">
           <div class="col-md-6">
                <!-- column 1 -->
           </div>
           <div class="col-md-6">
                <!-- column 2 -->
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>

10) What if we wanted to have a different layout for the columns on smaller devices that didn't set them all to 100% width. That can be done by mixing
column classes :
    a) Adding additional classes to each of our column <div>s will allow us to target the grid layout for different devices.
    
    b) The new layout look like :
            i) The first two columns should be 50% of the layout
           ii) The third column should stretch 100% of the layout and be below the first two

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-6">
                <!-- column 1 //-->
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-6">
                <!-- column 2 //-->
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
                <!-- column 3 //-->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
