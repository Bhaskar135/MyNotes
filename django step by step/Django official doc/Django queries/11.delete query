1) This delete() method immediately deletes the object and returns the number of objects deleted and a dictionary with the number of deletions per object type

>>> c1=Choice.objects.get(choice_text="Not much")
>>> c1.delete()
(1, {'polls.Choice': 1})

    1-> no of  object delete
    poll-> app name
    Choice-> model name
    

>>> c1=Choice.objects.filter(choice_text__icontains="o")
>>> c1.delete()
(3, {'polls.Choice': 3})

2) If you do want to delete all the objects, then you have to explicitly request a complete query set:

>>> Choice.objects.all().delete()
