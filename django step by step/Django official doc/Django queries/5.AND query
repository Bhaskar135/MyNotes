    This will return those objects which have entry headline Lennon and those entry may have or may not have pub_date_year 2008. as well as return those objects which have entry's pub_date_year is 2008.

exclude() :

>>> Blog.objects.exclude(
        entry__in=Entry.objects.filter(
            headline__contains='Lennon',
            pub_date__year=2008,
        ),
    )

    This will select all blogs that do not contain entries published with “Lennon” that were published in 2008, you need to make two queries.

>>> Blog.objects.exclude(
       entry__headline__contains='Lennon',
       entry__pub_date__year=2008,
    )

    This would exclude blogs that contain both entries with “Lennon” in the headline and entries published in 2008.
