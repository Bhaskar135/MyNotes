To compare two model instances, use the standard Python comparison operator, the double equals sign: ==. Behind the scenes, that compares the primary key values of two models.

Using the Entry example above, the following two statements are equivalent:

>>> some_entry == other_entry
>>> some_entry.id == other_entry.id
