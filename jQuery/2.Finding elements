1) Basic selector 

        a)*                            All elements

        b)element                      All elements with that element name
        
        c)#id                          Elements whose id attribute has the value specified
        
        d).class                       Elements whose cl ass attribute has the value specified
 
        e) selector1, selector2        Elements that match more than one selector (see also the .add() method, which is more efficient when combining selections)


2) Hierarchy selector

   a) ancestor descendant              An element that is a descendant of another element (e.g., li a)
   b) parent > child                   An element that is a direct child of another element (you can use * in the place of the child to select all child elements of the specified parent)

   c) previous + next                  Adjacent sibling selector only selects elements that are immediately followed by the previous element

   d) previous ~ siblings              Sibling selector will select any elements that are a sibling of the previous element


3) Basic filters

   a) :not (selector)                  All elements except the one in the selector (e.g., div: not ('#summary'))
  
   b) :first         (new)             The first element from the selection

   c) :last          (new)             The last element from the selection

   d) :even          (new)             Elements with an even index number in the selection

   e) :odd           (new)             Elements with an odd index number in the selection

   f) :eq(index)     (new)             Elements with an index number equal to the one in the parameter

   g) :gt(index)     (new)             Elements with an index number greater than the parameter

   h) :lt(index)     (new)             Elements with an index number less than the parameter

   i) :header        (new)             All <hl> - <h6> elements

   j) :animated      (new)             Elements that are currently being animated

   k) :focus                           The element that currently has focus


3) Content filters

   a) :contains('text')                Elements that contain the specified text as a parameter

   b) :empty                           All elements that have no children

   c) :parent            (new)         All elements that have a child node(can be text or element)

   d) :has(selector)     (new)         Elements that contain at least one element that matches the selector (e.g., div:has(p) matches all div elements that contain a <p> element)

  
4) Visibility filters

   a) :hidden        (new)             All elements that are hidden

   b) :visible       (new)             All elements that consume space in the layout of the page. Not selected if, display: none; height/width: O; ancestor is hidden. Selected if, visibility : hidden; opacity : 0 because they would take up space in layout.


5) Child filters

   a) :nth-child(expr)                 The value here is not zero-based e.g. ul li:nth-child(2)
 
   b) :first-child                     First child from the current selection

   c) :last-child                      Last child from the current selection

   d) :only-child                      When there is only one child of the element (div p:only-child)


6) Attribute filters

   a) [attribute]                            Elements that carry the specified attribute (with any value)

   b) [attribute ='value']                   Elements that carry the specified attribute with the specified value

   c) [attribute !='value']      (new)       Elements that carry the specified attribute but not the specified value

   d) [attribute ^= 'value']                 The value of the attribute begins with this value

   e) [attribute $= 'value']                 The value of the attribute ends with this value

   f) [attribute *= 'value']                 The value should appear somewhere in the attribute value

   g) [attribute |= 'value']                 Equal to given string, or starting with string and followed by a hyphen

   h) [attribute ~= 'value']                 The value should be one of the values in a space separated list

   i) [attribute][attribute2]                Elements that match all of the selectors
