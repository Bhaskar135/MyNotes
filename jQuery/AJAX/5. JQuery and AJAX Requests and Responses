 Requests :

1) jQuery provides several methods that handle Ajax requests.

2) The .load() method operates on a jQuery selection (like most jQuery methods). It loads new HTML content into the selected element(s).

    Method                             Description
  i) .load()             Loads HTML fragments into an element. It is the simplest method for retrieving data.

 ii) $.get()             Loads data using the HTTP GET method. Used to request data from the server.

iii) $.post()            Loads data using the HTTP POST method. Used to send data that updates data on server.

 iv) $.getJSON()         Loads JSON data using a GET request. Used for JSON data.

  v) $.getScript()       Loads and executes JavaScript data using GET. Used for JavaScript (e.g., JSONP) data.

 vi) $.ajax()            This method is used to perform all requests. The above methods all use this under the hood.


 Responses :

1) When using the .load() method, the HTML returned from the server is inserted into a jQuery selection.

2) For the other methods, you specify what should be done when the data that is returned using the jqXHR object.

3) jQuery has an object called jqXHR, which makes it easier to handle the data that is returned from the server.

   jqXHR Properties                  Description
  i) responseText                Text-based data returned

 ii) responseXML                 XML data returned

iii) status                      Status code

 iv) statusText                  Status description (typically used to display information about an error if one occurs)


   jqXHR Methods                   Description
  i) .done()                     Code to run if request was successful

 ii) .fail()                     Code to run if request was unsuccessful

iii) .always()                   Code to run if request succeeded or failed

 iv) .abort()                    Halt the communication
