1) To send data to the server, you are likely to use the .post() method.

2) jQuery also provides the .serialize() method to collect form data. It selects all of the information from the form. And then puts it into a string ready to send to the server.

3) It will only send successful form controls. It will nol send:: 
     
     a) Controls that have been disabled.

     b) Controls where no option has been selected.

     c) The submit button.

4) When a server-side page handles a form, you might want the same page to work whether:

     • It was a normal request for a web page (in which case you would send the whole page); or
          
     • It was an Ajax request (where you might respond with just a fragment of the page)

5) On the server, you can check whet her a page is being requested by an Ajax call using the X-Requested-With header.

6) If it is set and has a value of XMLHttpRequest, you know that the request was an Ajax request.

7) example :
 
   a) When users submit the form, an anonymous function runs.

   b) e.PreventDefault() stops the form from submitting.

   c) The form data is collected by the .serialize() method and stored in the details variable.

   d) The $.post() method is called using all three parameters :

       i) The url of the page that the data is being sent to

      ii) The data that was just collected from the form

     iii) A callback function that will display the results to the user

<form id="register" action="register.php" method="post">
     <h2>Register</h2>
     <label for="name"> Username</label>
     <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
     <label for="pwd"> Password</label>
     <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" />
     <label for="email"> Emai1 </label>
     <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
     <input type="submit" value="Join" />
</form>

   $('#register').on('submit', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var details = $('#register').serialize();
        $.post('register.php', details,function(data) { 
            $('#register').html(data);
        });
   });
